= LintReport

Runs the GemLint suite of checks against the latest version of all rubygems
available on rubygems.org.

Operates in a two stage process:

* stage one downloads the latest version of all gems and generate a machine
  parsable text file with failure data
* stage two parses the output from stage one and generates reports.

Only stage one is implemented, so second stage analysis is limited to grepping
the output log.

== Usage

  gem install lint_report
  lint_report --cachedir ~/gems --output data.log
  lint_website --data data.log --site ~/site

== Status

This is still a work in progress, proceed with caution.
