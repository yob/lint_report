= LintReport

Runs the GemLint suite of checks against all rubygems available on
rubygems.org.

The design is a two stage process

* stage one is to download the latest version of all gems and generate a machine
  parsable text file with failure data
* stage two it to parse the output from stage one and generate reports.

== Usage

  gem install lint_report
  lint_report --cachedir ~/gems --output data.log
  lint_website --data data.log --site ~/site

== Status

This is still a work in progress, proceed with caution.
